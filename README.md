# WiggleNowiggle
This project starts from the end of 2015. We are studying the systematics of BAO shape by using N-body simulations. We use simulation data 
from Yu Feng. Since the wiggled and no-wiggle power spectrum has the same initial setting, Pwig/Pnow or Pwig-Pnow cancels sample variance
a lot, which could decrease the number of simulations ~10 times.

The folder HS_pre_rec_run2_3 stroes code for dealing with pre-reconstruction power spectrum generated from Hee-Jong's code. And the folder
reconstruct_run2_3_power for post-reconstruction.

We are still doing the study. Wish us good luck!
